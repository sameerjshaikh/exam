//Arrays in C++.
/*
Any identifier can hold only one value at any given point of time.
If U want to store multiple values U should create that many no of variables.
For large such variables of the same type, it is hard to maintain that many no.
So we could create a group of variables of the same type and represent each with
the name and a [subscript] operator is done thro Arrays.
Arrays are fixed in size and are optimized as they hold contiginous memory when its
declared. The size of the array is decided before the array is created.

/*
POINT: If a set of functions have to be used across multiple files within a
project, U could group those functions inside a header file(Text file with an
extension .h and include them inside UR CPP file using #include directive
#include is more like an instruction to the processor to include(inject) the
file physically into the Cpp file before the processing begins.
